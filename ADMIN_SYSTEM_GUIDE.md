## 🏗️ **System Architecture**

### **Backend Components:**
1. **`passwordPolicy.js`** - Core password validation engine
2. **`routes/admin.js`** - Admin management API endpoints
3. **Azure Table Storage** - User data persistence
4. **JWT Authentication** - Secure token-based auth

### **Frontend Components:**
1. **`AdminLogin.tsx`** - Admin authentication with password change
2. **`AdminDashboard.tsx`** - Complete user management interface
3. **`AdminPortal.tsx`** - Main admin portal router

## 👤 **Default Admin Account**

When you start the backend, it automatically creates:

```
Username:admin
Email: admin@company.com
Password: [Auto-generated secure password - shown in console]
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: The admin account is created with a temporary password that:
- Must be changed on first login
- Expires in 24 hours
- Meets all security requirements
